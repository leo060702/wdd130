            <div class="example">
                <p>Hello! My name is Zhili Zhong, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a journey in Software Development through BYU Pathway Worldwide. With a strong foundation in Computer Science, gained through my previous studies at Citrus College and Saddleback College, I have developed a passion for creating innovative and practical tech solutions.</p>
                <p>I enjoy exploring programming languages like Java and Python and applying them to projects such as building user-friendly applications and systems. Beyond academics, I am deeply interested in learning about emerging technologies and contributing to projects that make a difference.</p>
                <p>When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me connecting with friends, attending church activities, or learning something new to broaden my horizons. I believe in the power of perseverance and lifelong learning to achieve both personal and professional growth.</p>
                <p>Feel free to explore my work, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!</p>
